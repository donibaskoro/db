We all, with no exception, happened to run in the dark, without knowing what served in front of us.

> It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.
Death smiles at us all, but all a man can do is smile back.
If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.
**- Marcus Aurelius** 

This unknown makes us vulnerable. Yet to live, is to begin.

> It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.
First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.
It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
**- Epitectus**

There will be many surprises, you better be ready.

> There are more things, Lucilius, that frighten us than injure us, and we suffer more in imagination than in reality.
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.
If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.
Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.
**- Seneca**

That it will never come again, is what make life so sweet.
