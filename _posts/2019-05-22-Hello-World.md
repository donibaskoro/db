We all, with no exception, happened to run in the dark, without knowing what served in front of us.

> It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.
Death smiles at us all, but all a man can do is smile back.
If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.
**- Marcus Aurelius** 

This unknown makes us vulnerable. Yet to live, is to begin.

> It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.
First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.
It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
**- Epitectus**

There will be many surprises, you better be ready.

> There are more things, Lucilius, that frighten us than injure us, that we suffer more in imagination than in reality.
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.
**- Seneca**

That it will never come again, is what make life so sweet.
